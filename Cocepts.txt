Q: whats difference between dev dependencies and dependicies?
        These are the packages your app needs to work when it’s running in production.
        These are tools you only use while writing code, testing, or building, but they’re not needed when the app is actually running live.
        💡 Rule of thumb:
        If your app won’t run without it — put it in dependencies.
        If your app only needs it while you’re coding — devDependencies.

Q:When we are creating an server in express , but server is huge box where we send req and res is our feedback, what is http server , why we need to use an express middleware while requiring express.?
		That’s what a server does — it talks to you using HTTP, which is just the polite language computers use to talk on the internet.
		🧱 What is an HTTP server?
	It’s the engine inside the box — like a mailman who:
	•	Takes your request
	•	Figures out where to send it
	•	Delivers a response back to you
		Let’s pretend:
	1.	A guest knocks on your door 🚪
	2.	Your butler (middleware) checks:
	•	Is their name on the list? ✅
	•	Are they carrying anything weird? ❌
	•	Should we clean up before responding? 🧼
	3.	Then they say: “Okay, pass it to the boss (you)”
    	•	🧃 HTTP server is like a juice machine — it gets your order and makes juice.
	•	🎩 Express is a fancy robot that makes juice faster and tastier.
	•	🧼 Middleware is a cleaning sponge. It washes the glass before giving you the juice!
